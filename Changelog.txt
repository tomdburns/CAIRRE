===============================================================================
Version 0.11.0 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added JavaCodes directory with CDK and PaDEL codes, with the goal of removing
  the dependency on OPERA

- Added descriptors.py to scripts which contains the code needed to run PaDEL
  and CDK directly without needing OPERA. It was then incorporated into 
  modules.ExecuteModels, meaning the code no longer relies on OPERA to generate
  descriptors and run models.

- Disabled all OPERA related calls and menus, no longer available in the GUI

- CAIRRE now allows the use of all available Fingerprints for similarity
  search without the need to run the CAIRRE models.

- Disabled the user "properties" tab since OPERA is no longer being run. This
  include self.tab2 and self.PropTable

- Added code which executes on launch to check for an existing java installation.
  if java is not detected, then the code disables any features reliant on the
  java modules, including all FingerPrints (except pRDF) and the "Run Model"
  button. Users can still explore the database using the pRDF FingerPrint.

===============================================================================
Version 0.10.2 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- fixed a bug causing the code to exit after running alternate fingerprints

===============================================================================
Version 0.10.1 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated the units in the properties windows, making the output more relevant
  to chemical evaluators

- Software now pushes an alerts pop-up without needing the user to click to
  "show alerts" button, with the goal to effectively communicate the alerts
  to the user.

- Fixed a bug where CAS 9002-93-1 was returning an incorrect SMILES from the
  CAS Search function.

- Added the option to perform the nearest neighbour search using the
  descriptors used by the CAIRRE and Oxnard models.

- Updated the negative removal handling in the nearest neighbours search to
  better align with the methodology used when developing CAIRRE training sets

- Updated user manual to include new functions and features.

- Fixed a bug in the CAS search that was causing CAIRRE to push a connection
  error when the database successfully returning a None object, meaning CAIRRE
  was interpreting to result as a failure to properly query the database.

- Fixed a bug that was causing CAIRRE to run the similarity search after the
  CAS Search function failed.

===============================================================================
Version 0.10.0 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated the table in the Nearest Neighbours windows to include CAS RNs and
  Median percent removal. The SMILES column was removed as it was deemed not
  useful.

- Fixed a bug in the domain check that was reversing the regression and
  classification models.

- Added CAIRRE_v2 regression model, based on updated fitting from the 2022
  eSMR document, using OPERA descriptors and N>2 measurements.

- Changed the Model Statistics plots from scatter plots to hexbins

- Changed the default models being displayed to the user

- Reduced the size of the nearest neighbour results table and added
  a table below the displays the weighted average of the N nearest neighbours

- Added an options tab to the Nearest Neighbour window to allow the user
  to fine tune the search, although with the exception of the number of
  chemicals included in the weighted average, none of these options are
  currently functional.

- Added tab to NN results window for substructure search, added "coming soon"
  message to tab since this functionality has not been added to the code.

- Added function to Backend.py called filter_array that filter's a chemical's
  experimental removal array according to the settings defined by the user;
  updated the surrounding code to accommodate the new format of the db search

===============================================================================
Version 0.9.1 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added a class to main called SystemDPI that checks the windows UI scaling
  settings of the user and determines the scaling factor for CAIRRE's GUI
- Applied the dpi.scale factor across the GUI setup to allow for dynamic scaling
  based on the largest scaling factor detected (IE code uses largest factor when
  multiple monitors are in use.)
- Modified the lines in the UI to not look ridiculous at other scales

===============================================================================
Version 0.9.0 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added function that allows the user to search by CAS RN that considers the
  complete dataset used for CAIRRE, as well as performs an internet search
  for the CAS RN or the SMILES
  -> modified the UI to incorporate this functionality
  -> added a toolbar menu option to allow the user to toggle the online
     functionality on and off
  -> added a toolbar menu option to automatically run a similarity search
     using pRDF function

===============================================================================
Version 0.8.2 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added option in "About" menu to look at the descriptors in the models
  -> This button opens a file called desc.pdf which is one of the SI documents
     for the CAIRRE publication describing the descriptors.

===============================================================================
Version 0.8.1 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added fault tolerances for failed OPERA calculations in single substance
  calculations

- Added Rerun OPERA checkbox that will be used to force the rerun of OPERA
  calculations when a run fails

- Adjusted experimental removal histogram bins to make the distribution of
  percent removals to be more clear, now has fixed bin sizes
  (10 bins, 10% per bin)

===============================================================================
Version 0.8.0 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added double click functionality to training set table.

- Added fault tolerances for failed calculations due to NaN values in
  descriptor arrays

- Added code to click_search function to accommodate the new fingerprint types
  > Added function to scripts.Backend.py: closest2, which can handle the new
    fingerprint types
  > Added error message when an OPERA based descriptor is chosen as the
    fingerprint, when no OPERA data available for user's substance

- Created the scripts.fprint_handler.py file that contains functions needed
  to import the fingerprint information from OPERA

- Fixed a bug where several database substances had NaN'ed phys-chem
  properties by recalculating those properties with OPERA

- Changed the scale of the nearest neighbour histograms to read from 0 to 100%

- Added a tab widget to the main window in the Nearest Neighbour section, with
  the structure of the neighbour molecule in one window and the phys-chem
  properties in the other.

- Added a tab widget to the main window, with the structure on one tab, and
  a readout of some selected phys-chem properties calculated using OPERA for
  the user's substance
  - Also added a new function to update the table when data becomes available

- Removed the MW check box in the main GUI, however the code remains in the
  app intact for now.

===============================================================================
Version 0.7.2 (beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed extra files from directory that are no longer used by code

- Changed the default paths that file dialog windows start at to improve QoL

- Updated file explorer window titles to be descriptive of its purpose.

  in main.py that opens data\Pub.pdf.
  -> Current placeholder pdf created, will be updated once the work has been
     published.

- Updated/Tested code with OPERA CL v2.8 (the most up to date version at the
  time of this update)
  -> NOTE: CAME ACROSS A WEIRD BUG THAT CAUSED CRASH
           - CANNOT GUARANTEE 2.8 WILL WORK

- Added function linked to 'Download OPERA CL v2.7' menubar option called
  download_opera() in main.py that directly downloads the correct version
  of OPERA CL
  - Changed link from official OPERA github to my personal google descriptive
  - Version on Github is currently only 2.8 (see above issue with v2.8)

- Added two warnings when file opens in new function check_opera():
  -> warning 1: OPERA_PATH.ini not found
  -> warning 2: OPERA.exe path does not exist
  check_opera() runs as soon as the UI is loaded.

- Added function linked to 'Set OPERA CL Path' item in menu called set_opera_path
  so that the user can now set the path to the opera exe from inside the program
  without having to manually edit exe files.

- Added a menu bar with two columns: OPERA and About
  -> In OPERA: Set OPERA CL Path, Download OPERA CL v2.8
  -> In About: Publications

- Fixed a typo in batch output file column name
